        This dashboard allows you to explore job matches based on various similarity metrics such as:
        - **Overall match:** cosine similarity between job descriptions and your CV
        - **Skills match:** comparison of job-required skills with your listed skills
        - **Language match:** matching job description language and requirements with your spoken languages
        - **Location match:** job locations compared to your preferred locations
        - **Experience match:** job descriptions compared to your preferred experience

        You can filter and rank job postings to better suit your profile.

    1. **Data Collection**: Job postings are scraped from LinkedIn using a configuration file that specifies filters (e.g., keywords, locations, job types).
    2. **Vectorization & Similarity Matching**: We compute embeddings (with distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1) for job descriptions and your CV, then apply cosine similarity to rank job postings.
    3. **Preference-based Ranking**: Jobs are ranked based on a combination of:
    - Overall match
    - Matching skills
    - Preferred job titles
    - Experience level
    - Language requirements
    - Location preferences
    4. **Interactive Filtering**: Use the dashboard to refine search results and focus on the best matches.
    5. **Jobs match page**: See the best ranked job offer in a table view with many filters available.
    6. **Jobs locations page**: Explore job locations on a map with multiple filtering options.
